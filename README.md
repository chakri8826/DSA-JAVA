# 🚀 DSA & LeetCode Solutions in Java

**Welcome to my problem-solving repository!**  
This repository contains a curated collection of Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) solutions — written in Java — that I’ve solved during my coding journey.

## 📂 Repository Structure & Topics Covered

| Module / Topic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Arrays** | Array related problems: basic/advanced, sliding window, prefix sums, 2-pointers etc. |
| **Strings** | String manipulation, pattern matching, substring problems, palindromes, etc. |
| **LinkedList** | Singly / Doubly linked list problems — insertions, deletions, merges, cycles, etc. |
| **BinarySearch** | Search & binary-search-on-answer pattern problems. |
| **StacksQueues** | Classic stack/queue problems, monotonic stack, sliding window, etc. |
| **BinaryTrees / BST** | Tree traversals, BST operations, tree-based problems (DFS/BFS). |
| **Graphs** | Graph algorithms: BFS, DFS, shortest paths, connectivity, topological sort, etc. |
| **Heaps** | Priority-queue based problems (kth largest, merge k lists, streaming data, etc.). |
| **DynamicProgramming** | DP problems: 1-D, 2-D, knapsack, LIS, DP on trees/strings etc. |
| **Greedy** | Greedy-approach problems, interval scheduling, greedy + sorting, greedy with heaps, etc. |
| **BackTracking / Recursion** | Recursion, backtracking, subsets / permutations / combinations / backtracking templates. |
| **BitManipulation** | Bitwise-technique problems. |
| **TwoPointersSlidingWindow** | Sliding window & two-pointer technique problems. |
| **Tries / Map / PrefixSuffixArrays / Other Misc** | Special data structure and mixture problems. |
